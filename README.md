# Data visualization using Plotly express in Python (demo)

Made a little demo to visualize the LEGO dataset with a few research questions in mind: 

  1. Is there any pattern in the number of parts per set over the years?
  
  2. How many variants of sets do the top *n* themes have?
  
  3. How many times do *n* popular parts appears in *n* random sets?
  
If I ever revisit this or polish it up, I'd:

  * Make the heat map labels human readable instead of the ID garbage.
  
  * Update the dataset.
  
  * Refactor the code into helpers and generally just optimize it a little (hopefully!)
